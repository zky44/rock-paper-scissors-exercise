# rock-paper-scissors-exercise

# To start this exercise, do the following steps

+ Create a repo for the exercise. I called it "rock-paper-scissors-exercise
+ Create a file in that repo called "game.py" and add the following code inside
    # print("Rock, Paper, Scissors, Shoot!")
+ Create a new project-specific Anaconda virtual environment called "my-game-env". If you already did this, ignore that step
+ Activate the my-game-env
+ Use "python game.py" to run the code
